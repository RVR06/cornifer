Code snippets and code completion serve two purposes: gently supporting newcomers early stages, while smartly speeding up veteran velocity.

`Cornifer` provides a broad palette of snippets for all main C4 DSL keywords (structure, model, view, ...). Start typing and leverage code completion to fuel a TAB-jump placeholder structure, enabling blazing fast edition.

Once again, without language server, code completion is not contextual for the moment, but it will soon be.
