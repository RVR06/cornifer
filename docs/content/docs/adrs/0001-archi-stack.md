## Decision

Promote architecture as code, from [vs code](https://code.visualstudio.com) to [structurizr lite](https://www.structurizr.com/help/lite).

## Context

We need an [ubiquitous diagramming language](https://rvr06.github.io/c4-bootcamp/) and we need efficient stack to operate.

## Consequences

Provide relevant tooling, especially upstream for authoring chain aka `Cornifer`.
