## Decision

Provide clear definition of what means what, and where and when to use what.

## Context

There is messy taxonomy around between `Structurizr`, `Structurizr DSL`, `C4 model` and their inherent coupling.
Moreover, choosen `.dsl` - aka **D**omain **S**pecific **L**anguage - file extension does not look very `C4` or `Structurizr` exclusive.

## Consequences
